      <p>Our group is interested in inferring physically and spatially grounded representations from perceptual input, and leveraging these for advances in fundamental problems in computer vision and robot manipulation.</p>
      <p>Our research spans 3D reconstruction and neural rendering from sparse observations, physics-based simulation and dynamics prediction, object-centric understanding and shape reasoning, generative models for 3D content creation, and robot learning for manipulation tasks.</p>
